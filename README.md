# Go-Food
Realtime Location tracker for Food Trucks.

# Problem Definition: 
The current problem is that there is no proper food truck application that gives realtime location details to the user. Currently, it’s hard for the user to keep track of their favorite food truck locations across their town. Without my app people cannot know accurately what’s going on with food trucks. This app enhances the bridge of connectivity between both the food lovers and food trucks.

# Specific Problems: 
Currently food trucks aren’t using technology efficiently in connecting with the users and many food trucks are currently facing problems in informing their users about their location. By utilizing this mobile application they not only enable users to track them but also increases their revenue and more outreach.

# Scope of the Project: 
* My application mainly focuses on giving time to time realtime location updates to the user and make food truck updates it’s location regularly. The crisp lies in providing the information that is required to the user and removing the unwanted information.
* The design methodology is trying to create a simple application that connects user with the necessary information quickly and efficiently.
* My application makes sure there’s an easy and effective communication between user and the owner without any interruption in the flow of business.
* Will maintain a database for the user and owner to store the data.
* To provide respective locations to the users will be using google location API. This used to display location of the food truck.
* My application is created in Android Studio.
